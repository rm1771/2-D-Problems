# 2-D Problems

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to exploring two-dimensional dynamical systems through Python simulations. It includes detailed examples of the classical two-body and three-body problems in physics, which help in understanding the fundamentals of motion under gravitational forces. 

## Content
1. **Two-Body Problem**: Python scripts simulate the interaction between two masses under gravitational attraction, demonstrating orbits and trajectories based on initial conditions.
2. **Three-Body Problem**: Extends the complexity to three interacting bodies, showing the chaotic and unpredictable nature of these systems when additional bodies are involved.

## Goals
The aim of this repository is to provide a hands-on approach to learning classical mechanics principles, specifically Newtonian gravity, through visualization of 2D simulations.

## Usage
To run the simulations:
- Ensure Python 3.11 is installed.
- Install required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to improve the simulations or add new features, please fork the repository and submit a pull request.
